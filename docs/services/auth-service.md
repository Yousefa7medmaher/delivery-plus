# Auth Service

## Purpose
Handles registration, authentication, and JWT-based identity for users and roles.

## Main REST endpoints
From `services/auth-service/src/controllers/auth.controller.ts`:

- `POST /auth/register` – register a new user and create a profile
- `POST /auth/login` – sign in and receive a JWT token
- `GET /auth/me` – return the current user payload from the bearer token

## Dependencies
- Calls `user-service` internally for user profile creation via `src/common/user-service.client.ts`, signing the request with the internal HMAC contract
- Requires `DATABASE_URL` and `JWT_SECRET`
- Uses Redis indirectly through shared rate-limit infrastructure and shared app config

## Events published/consumed
- No Kafka producers or consumers are implemented in this service.

## Required env vars
From `services/auth-service/src/config/app-config.ts` and `docker-compose.yml`:

- `DATABASE_URL`
- `JWT_SECRET`
- `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` (default: `1h`)
- `USER_SERVICE_URL` (default: `http://localhost:3002`)
- `PORT` (default: `3001`)
- `NODE_ENV` (default: `development`)
- `INTERNAL_AUTH_SECRET` (required in production; local Compose provides a development-only default)

## Notes
The auth service validates credentials and issues JSON Web Tokens; downstream access control is enforced with shared guards from `@food-delivery/shared`. Its profile-creation call uses HMAC service authentication with a service identity, timestamp, nonce, and body-bound signature. A shared `INTERNAL_AUTH_SECRET` must be rotated through deployment configuration, not source code.
