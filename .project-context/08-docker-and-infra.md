# Docker and Infrastructure

## Infrastructure stack

This repository is designed to run locally with Docker Compose. The setup includes both infrastructure services and application services.

The compose definition is in:

- [docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml)

## Core infrastructure components

### PostgreSQL

- Service name: `postgres`
- Image: `postgres:16-alpine`
- Port: `5432`
- Mounted init script: [docker/postgres/init.sql](../docker/postgres/init.sql)

Purpose:

- durable relational storage for service-owned domain tables
- each service uses its own logical database name inside the same PostgreSQL instance

### Redis

- Service name: `redis`
- Image: `redis:7-alpine`
- Port: `6379`

Purpose:

- cart state
- delivery/tracking location state
- low-latency runtime data

### Kafka and Zookeeper

- `zookeeper` runs on port `2181`
- `kafka` runs on port `9092`
- Kafka UI is exposed on `8085`

Purpose:

- event transport between services
- asynchronous updates for order, payment, and delivery lifecycle changes

## Service startup model

The stack is built with health checks and `depends_on` conditions. This is important because it avoids starting dependent services before their backing infrastructure is actually ready.

Examples from the compose file:

- `postgres` must be healthy before app services start
- `kafka` requires healthy `zookeeper`
- app services wait on infra and downstream dependencies before becoming healthy

## Application service startup pattern

The root build configuration uses a Docker build arg called `SERVICE_NAME` to build individual services. This is reflected in the root Dockerfile and the compose service definitions.

The important behavior is:

- every service is containerized individually
- they all share the same infra dependencies
- network-level references use internal Docker hostnames such as `auth-service`, `order-service`, and `kafka`

## Health checks

Each app service exposes a `/health` route and uses a Docker healthcheck like:

- `wget --spider -q http://localhost:<port>/health`

This makes startup order deterministic and makes the stack easier to reason about when debugging issues.

## Environment conventions

The compose file uses environment variables for local defaults, including:

- `POSTGRES_USER`
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
- `JWT_SECRET`

Most services receive connection URLs like:

- `DATABASE_URL=postgres://...@postgres:5432/<database_name>`
- `REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379`
- `KAFKA_BROKER=kafka:29092`

## Observability and debugging

The stack includes Kafka UI for broker inspection and service health checks for container readiness. This is enough for local development and debugging, but not for a full production observability stack.

## Database bootstrap and migration flow

The Compose stack uses a service-owned Postgres model. The Postgres container is named `postgres` and is configured with:

- `POSTGRES_USER=${POSTGRES_USER:-postgres}`
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:-postgres}`
- logical databases created by [docker/postgres/init.sql](../docker/postgres/init.sql)

This init script creates one logical database per service, such as `auth_service`, `user_service`, `order_service`, and `payment_service`. The Dockerized app services then connect using `DATABASE_URL` values such as `postgres://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/order_service`.

The service applications are intentionally configured with `synchronize: false` and `migrationsRun: false` in their TypeORM config. That means the schema is created by TypeORM migration files stored under each service’s `src/database/migrations` directory, and the migration history table is used to track applied versions.

In Docker-based startup, each built service image runs the migration step before the application process starts. This is the repository’s deployment-safe path for fresh databases and local development, and it prevents untracked schema creation from runtime sync.

## Operational caveats

A few important caveats are worth keeping in mind:

- the stack is meant for local development and demo use
- service startup order matters, especially for Kafka and Postgres initialization
- environment defaults are intentionally simple and may be replaced in real deployments
- container health checks assume the service exposes `/health` correctly
- database schema changes must be shipped as migrations; runtime `synchronize` is disabled
- a migration is intended to be forward-only once it has run in shared environments
