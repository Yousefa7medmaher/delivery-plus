# Project Context Index

This folder is a lightweight, machine-readable knowledge base for AI agents and contributors. The goal is to answer: “What is this project, what does each service do, and where should I look before I edit anything?”

## Required reading order for AI agents

Any AI agent working on an issue in this repo should read this folder first, starting with 01 through 03, then jump to the specific service/topic file relevant to the issue, before writing any code.

Suggested sequence:

1. [01-project-overview.md](./01-project-overview.md)
2. [02-system-architecture.md](./02-system-architecture.md)
3. [03-service-map.md](./03-service-map.md)
4. Jump to the relevant service doc in [../docs/services.md](../docs/services.md)
5. Then read the specific topic file that matches the issue, such as [05-event-driven-design.md](./05-event-driven-design.md), [06-api-gateway.md](./06-api-gateway.md), or [08-docker-and-infra.md](./08-docker-and-infra.md)

## Relationship to the docs folder

This folder stays broad and high-level. Detailed service-level contract docs live in [../docs/services.md](../docs/services.md) and the per-service pages under [../docs/services](../docs/services).

The repository has a local roadmap under [../issues/README.md](../issues/README.md), but `.gitignore` excludes `issues/` and the directory is not part of the tracked application tree. GitHub is the authoritative remote issue state; local issue files are working metadata only. This folder remains the architecture source of truth.

## Scope

This folder is descriptive only. It is not a coding standard, a task runner, or a behavior policy document.
