# Environment and Setup

## Local run model

This project is intended to run with a Docker Compose-based local stack for infrastructure and all application services. The main orchestration file is:

- [docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml)

## Required infrastructure

The stack expects the following runtime dependencies:

- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Zookeeper
- Kafka
- multiple NestJS application services

These are all defined in the compose file and are expected to start in dependency order using health checks.

## Core environment variables

Common runtime values include:

- `POSTGRES_USER`
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
- `JWT_SECRET`
- service-specific URLs such as `AUTH_SERVICE_URL`, `ORDER_SERVICE_URL`, and `KAFKA_BROKER`

The compose file sets practical local defaults, including a development JWT secret and default Postgres credentials.

## Database conventions

Each service configures a `DATABASE_URL` pointing to the same Postgres instance but a different logical database name, such as:

- `auth_service`
- `user_service`
- `restaurant_service`
- `menu_service`
- `order_service`
- `payment_service`
- `delivery_service`
- `driver_service`
- `notification_service`

This keeps service data isolated while sharing the same infrastructure environment.

## Typical local workflow

A practical developer flow is:

1. install Node dependencies from the workspace root
2. run the stack with Docker Compose
3. confirm service health routes and inspect the gateway healthcheck mismatch
4. use the gateway on port `3000`
5. inspect Kafka on `localhost:8085` via Kafka UI if needed

## Service URL conventions

The system assumes internal service-to-service access names like:

- `http://auth-service:3001`
- `http://order-service:3006`
- `http://delivery-service:3008`
- `http://kafka:29092`

These names are used inside Docker networking and are not necessarily meant to be called directly from the host machine.

## Port map summary

| Purpose | Port |
| --- | ---: |
| API Gateway | 3000 |
| Auth Service | 3001 |
| User Service | 3002 |
| Restaurant Service | 3003 |
| Menu Service | 3004 |
| Cart Service | 3005 |
| Order Service | 3006 |
| Payment Service | 3007 |
| Delivery Service | 3008 |
| Driver Service | 3009 |
| Tracking Service | 3010 |
| Notification Service | 3011 |
| PostgreSQL | 5432 |
| Redis | 6379 |
| Kafka | 9092 |
| Kafka UI | 8085 |

## Notes for contributors

- service URLs and ports are defined centrally in compose, not hidden in code
- stack startup is configuration-driven, but full readiness is not guaranteed by the current gateway healthcheck
- local defaults are suitable for development, not for production credentials or security settings
